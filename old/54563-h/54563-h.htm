<h2>THE CASTLE OF TERMON MAGRATH, COUNTY OF DONEGAL.</h2>

<p>In a recent number of our journal we called the attention of
our readers to the little-appreciated beauties of Lough Erne;
and we now present them with another vista of that delightful
locality in connection with the Castle of Termon Magrath, or
Termon, as it is more usually called, which is situated at its
northern extremity, in the county of Donegal. Considered as
a sheet of water, the lower lake appears from this side to the
greatest advantage; but its distant shores are but little improved
by plantations, and consequently look comparatively
bleak and barren. In the immediate vicinity of our subject,
however, the scenery is of the rich character for which Lough
Erne is so remarkable, the shores of the lake being fringed
with the plantations of the glebe of Templecarn and those of
Waterfoot, the beautiful seat of Colonel Barton.</p>

<p>The Castle of Termon is situated in the parish of Templecarn,
about half a mile to the west of the pleasant and improving
little town of Pettigoe, which, if it had a comfortable
inn, would be a good station for pleasure tourists wishing to
enjoy the scenery of the lower Lough Erne and that of Lough
Derg, with its celebrated purgatory of St Patrick.</p>

<p>The foundation of this castle, according to popular tradition,
is ascribed to the celebrated Malmurry, or, as he was
usually called, Myler Magrath, the first Protestant Bishop of
Clogher; and there is every reason to believe this tradition
correct. The lands on which the castle is situated anciently
constituted the Termon of St Daveog of Lough Derg, of which
the Magraths were hereditarily the termoners or churchwardens;
and of this family Myler Magrath was the head; so that
these lands properly belonged to him anteriorly to any grant of
them derived through his bishopric. He was originally a
Franciscan friar, and being a man of distinguished abilities,
was advanced by Pope Pius V. to the see of Down; but having
afterwards embraced Protestantism, he was placed in the
see of Clogher by letter of Queen Elizabeth, dated 18th May
1570, and by grant dated the 18th September, in the same
year. He remained, however, but a short time in this see, in
which he received but little or nothing of the revenues, and in
which he was probably surrounded by enemies even among
his own kindred, and was translated to the archbishopric of
Cashel on the 3d of February, in the year following. He died
at Cashel at the age of one hundred, in the year 1622, and
was interred in the choir of that ancient cathedral, where a
splendid monument to his memory still exists, with a Latin
inscription penned by himself, of which the following quaint
translation is given in Harris’s Ware:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Patrick, the glory of our isle and gown,</div>
<div class="verse">First sat a bishop in the see of Down.</div>
<div class="verse">I wish that I, succeeding him in place</div>
<div class="verse">As bishop, had an equal share of grace.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
<div class="verse">I served thee, England, fifty years in jars,</div>
<div class="verse">And pleased thy princes in the midst of wars;</div>
<div class="verse">Here where I’m placed I’m not; and thus the case is,</div>
<div class="verse">I’m not in both, yet am in both the places. 1621.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">He that judgeth me is the Lord.&mdash;1 Cor. iv.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Let him who stands take care lest he fall.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Harris remarks, that the Roman Catholics of his diocese have
a tradition that he returned to his original faith previously to
his death, and that though it was pretended that he was buried
in his own cathedral, yet he had given private orders for
burying his body elsewhere, to which circumstance, as they
say, the two last lines of his epitaph allude. “But,” says
Harris, “although he was no good man, and had impoverished
his see by stripping it of much of its ancient estate, yet I do
not find any room to call his sincerity as to his religious profession
in question, living or dying. These lines rather seem
to hint at the separate existence of the soul and body.” But
however this may be, there is another tradition relative to
him less doubtful, inasmuch as it is common to the peasantry
of different creeds, namely, that he was the handsomest man
in Ireland in his day!</p>

<p>The Castle of Termon, like most edifices of the kind erected
in the sixteenth century, consisted of a strong keep with
circular towers at two of its angles, and encompassed by outworks.
It was battered by Ireton from the neighbouring hill
in the parliamentary wars; but its ruins are considerable, and
by their picturesqueness add interest to the northern shore of
the lower Lough Erne.</p>

<h2 class="gap4">THE IRISH MIDWIFE.<br />
<span class="smaller">BY WILLIAM CARLETON.</span></h2>

<h3>Introductory.</h3>

<p>Of the many remarkable characters that have been formed
by the spirit and habits of Irish feeling among the peasantry,
there is not one so clear, distinct, and well traced, as that of
the Midwife. We could mention several that are certainly
marked with great precision, and that stand out in fine relief
to the eye of the spectator, but none at all, who in richness
of colouring, in boldness of outline, or in firmness and force,
can for a moment be compared with the Midwife. The Fiddler
for instance lives a life sufficiently graphic and distinct;
so does the Dancing-master, and so also does the Matchmaker,
but with some abatement of colouring. As for the
Cosherer, the Shanahie, the Keener, and the Foster-nurse,
although all mellow toned, and well individualized by the strong
power of hereditary usage, yet do they stand dim and shadowy,
when placed face to face with this great exponent of
national temperament.</p>

<p>It is almost impossible to conceive a character of greater
self-importance than an Irish Midwife, or who exhibits in her
whole bearing a more complacent consciousness of her own
privileges. The Fiddler might be dispensed with, and the
Dancing-master might follow him off the stage; the Cosherer,
Shanahie, Keener, might all disappear, and the general business
of life still go on as before. But not so with her whom
we are describing; and this conviction is the very basis
of her power, the secret source from which she draws the confidence
that bears down every rival claim upon the affections
of the people.</p>

<p>Before we introduce Rose Moan to our kind readers, we
shall briefly relate a few points of character peculiar to the
Irish Midwife, because they are probably not in general known
to a very numerous class of our readers. This is a matter
which we are the more anxious to do, because it is undeniable
that an acquaintance with many of the old legendary powers
with which she was supposed to be invested, is fast fading
out of the public memory; and unless put into timely record,
it is to be feared that in the course of one or two generations
more, they may altogether disappear and be forgotten.</p>

<p>One of the least known of the secrets which old traditionary
lore affirmed to have been in possession of the Midwife, was the
knowledge of how beer might be brewed from heather. The
Irish people believe that the Danes understood and practised
this valuable process, and will assure you that the liquor prepared
from materials so cheap and abundant was superior in
strength and flavour to any ever produced from malt. Nay,
they will tell you how it conferred such bodily strength and courage
upon those who drank it, that it was to the influence
and virtue of this alone that the Danes held such a protracted
sway, and won so many victories in Ireland. It was a secret,
however, too valuable to be disclosed, especially to enemies,
who would lose no time in turning the important consequences
of it against the Danes themselves. The consequence was,
that from the day the first Dane set foot upon the soil of Ireland,
until that upon which they bade it adieu for ever, no
Irishman was ever able to get possession of it. It came to be
known, however, and the knowledge of it is said to be still in the
country, but must remain unavailable until the fulfilment of a
certain prophecy connected with the liberation of Ireland
shall take away the obligation of a most solemn oath, which
bound the original recipient of the secret to this conditional
silence. The circumstances are said to have been these:&mdash;</p>

<p>On the evening previous to the final embarkation of the
Danes for their own country, the wife of their prince was
seized with the pains of childbirth, and there being no midwife
among themselves, an Irish one was brought, who, as the enmity
between the nations was both strong and bitter, resolutely
withheld her services, unless upon the condition of being
made acquainted with this invaluable process. The crisis it
seems being a very trying one, the condition was complied
with; but the midwife was solemnly sworn never to communicate
it to any but a woman, and never to put it in practice
until Ireland should be free, and any two of its provinces at
peace with each other. The midwife, thinking very naturally
that there remained no obstacle to the accomplishment of
these conditions but the presence of the Danes themselves,
and seeing that they were on the eve of leaving the country
for ever, imagined herself perfectly safe in entering into the
obligation; but it so happened, says the tradition, that although
the knowledge of the secret is among the Irish midwives
still, yet it never could be applied, and never will, until Ireland
shall be in the state required by the terms of her oath. So
runs the tradition.</p>

<p>There is, however, one species of power with which some of
the old midwives were said to be gifted, so exquisitely ludicrous,
and yet at the same time so firmly fixed in the belief of
many among the people, that we cannot do justice to the character
without mentioning so strange an acquisition. It is
this, that where a husband happens to be cruel to his wife, or
suspects her unjustly, the Midwife is able, by some mysterious
charm, to inflict upon him and remove from the wife the sufferings
annexed to her confinement, as the penalty mentioned
by holy writ which is to follow the sex in consequence of the
transgression of our mother Eve. Some of our readers may
perhaps imagine this to be incredible, but we assure them
that it is strictly true. Such a superstition did prevail in Ireland
among the humbler classes, and still does, to an extent
which would surprise any one not as well acquainted with old
Irish usages and superstitions as we happen to be. The manner
in which the Midwife got possession of this power is as
follows:&mdash;It sometimes happened that the “good people,” or
<i lang="ga">Dhoine Shee</i>&mdash;that is, the fairies&mdash;were put to the necessity of
having recourse to the aid of the Midwife. On one of those
occasions it seems, the good woman discharged her duties so
successfully, that the fairy matron, in requital for her services
and promptitude of attendance, communicated to her this
secret, so formidable to all bad husbands. From the period
alluded to, say the people, it has of course been gladly transmitted
from hand to hand, and on many occasions resorted to
with fearful but salutary effect. Within our own memory
several instances of its application were pointed out to us,
and the very individuals themselves, when closely interrogated,
were forced to an assertion that was at least equivalent
to an admission, “it was nothing but an attack of the
cholic,” which by the way was little else than a libel upon that
departed malady. Many are the tales told of cases in which
midwives were professionally serviceable to the good people;
but unless their assistance was repaid by the communication
of some secret piece of knowledge, it was better to receive no
payment, any other description of remuneration being considered
unfortunate. Some of those stories have been well told,
and with others of them we may probably amuse our readers
upon some future occasion.</p>

<p>From this source also was derived another most valuable
quality said to be possessed by the Irish Midwife, but one
which we should suppose the virtue of our fair countrywomen
rendered of very infrequent application. This was the power
of destroying jealousy between man and wife. We forget
whether it was said to be efficacious in cases of guilt, but we
should imagine that the contrary would rather hold good, as
an Irishman is not exactly that description of husband who
would suffer himself to be charmed back into the arms of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
polluted wife. This was effected by the knowledge of a certain
herb, a decoction of which the parties were to drink nine
successive times, each time before sunrise and after sunset.
Of course the name of the herb was kept a profound secret;
but even if it had been known, it could have proved of little
value, for the full force of its influence depended on a charm
which the Midwife had learned among the fairies. Whether
it was the <em>Anacampserotes</em> of the middle ages or not, is difficult
to say; but one thing is certain, that not only have midwives,
but other persons of both sexes, gone about through the
country professing to cure jealousy by the juice or decoction
of a mysterious herb, which was known only to themselves.
It is not unlikely to suppose that this great secret after all
was nothing more than a perverted application of the Waters
of Jealousy mentioned by Moses, and that it only resembled
many other charms practised in this and other countries, which
are generally founded upon certain passages of Scripture.
Indeed, there is little doubt that the practice of attempting to
cure jealousy by herbs existed elsewhere as well as in Ireland;
and one would certainly imagine that Shakspeare, who left
nothing connected with the human heart untouched, must
have alluded to the very custom we are treating of, when he
makes Iago, speaking of Othello’s jealousy, say,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Look where he comes! not poppy nor mandragora,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,</div>
<div class="verse">Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep</div>
<div class="verse">Which thou hadst yesterday.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Here it is quite evident that the efficacy of the “syrups”
spoken of was to be tried upon the mind only in which the
Moor’s horrible malady existed. That Shakspeare, in the
passage quoted, alluded to this singular custom, is, we think,
at least extremely probable.</p>

<p>We have said that the Midwife stood high as a matchmaker,
and so unquestionably she did. No woman was better acquainted
with charms of all kinds, especially with those that
were calculated to aid or throw light upon the progress of
love. If for instance young persons of either sex felt doubt
as to whether their passion was returned, they generally consulted
the Midwife, who, on hearing a statement of their apprehensions,
appointed a day on which she promised to satisfy
them. Accordingly, at the time agreed upon, she and the
party interested repaired as secretly as might be, and with
much mystery, to some lonely place, where she produced a
Bible and key, both of which she held in a particular position&mdash;that
is, the Bible suspended by a string which passed through
the key. She then uttered with a grave and solemn face the
following verses from the Book of Ruth, which the young person
accompanying her was made to repeat slowly and deliberately
after her:&mdash;</p>

<p>“And Ruth said, entreat me not to leave thee or to return
from following after thee: for whither thou goest I will go;
and where thou lodgest I will lodge: thy people shall be my
people, and thy God my God:</p>

<p>“Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried:
the Lord do so to me, and more also, if aught but death part
thee and me.”</p>

<p>If at the conclusion of these words the Bible turned, she
affirmed, with the air of a prophetess, not only that the affection
of the parties was mutual, but that their courtship would
terminate in marriage. If, on the contrary, it remained stationary,
the passion existed only on one side, and the parties
were not destined for each other. Oh, credulous love! not to
see that the venerable sybil could allow the Bible to turn or
not, just as she may have previously ascertained from either
party whether their attachment was reciprocal or otherwise!
We dare say the above charm is seldom resorted to now,
and of course this harmless imposition on the lovers will soon
cease to be practised at all.</p>

<p>The Midwife’s aid to lovers, however, did not stop here.
If they wished to create a passion in some heart where it had
not previously existed, she told them to get a dormouse and
reduce it to powder, a pinch of which, if put into the drink of
the person beloved, would immediately rivet his or her affections
upon the individual by whose hands it was administered.
Many anecdotes are told of humorous miscarriages that resulted
from a neglect of this condition. One is especially
well known, of a young woman who gave the potion through
the hands of her grandmother; and the consequence was, that
the bachelor immediately made love to the old lady instead of
the young one, and eventually became grandfather to the latter
instead of her husband. Indeed, the administering of
philtres and the use of charms in Ireland were formerly very
frequent, and occasionally attended by results which had not
been anticipated. The use especially of <em>cantharides</em>, or French
flies, in the hands of the ignorant, has often been said to induce
madness, and not unfrequently to occasion death. It is not
very long since a melancholy case of the latter from this very
cause appeared in an Irish newspaper.</p>

<p>The Midwife was also a great interpreter of dreams, omens,
auguries, and signs of all possible sorts, and no youngsters
who ever consulted her need be long at a loss for a personal
view of the object of their love. They had only to seek in
some remote glen or dell for a briar whose top had taken root
in the ground; this they were to put under their pillow and
sleep upon, and the certain consequence was, that the image of
the future wife or husband would appear to them in a dream.
She was also famous at cup-tossing; and nothing could surpass
the shrewd and sapient expression of her face as she sat
solemnly peering into the grounds of the tea for the imaginary
forms of rings, and love-letters, and carriages, which were
necessary to the happy purport of her divination, for she felt
great reluctance to foretell calamity. She seldom, however,
had recourse to card-cutting, which she looked upon as an
unholy practice; the cards, as everyone knows, being the only
book on which the devil says his prayers night and morning.
Who has not heard of his <em>prayer-book</em>?</p>

<p>We are now to consider the Midwife in the capacity of a
woman not only brimful of medicinal knowledge, but possessed
of many secrets, which the mere physician or apothecary could
never penetrate. As a doctress, she possessed a very high reputation
for all complaints incident to children and females;
and where herbal skill failed, unlike the mere scientific man
of diplomas, she could set physical causes and effects aside,
and have recourse at once to the supernatural and miraculous.</p>

<p>For instance, there are two complaints which she is, beyond
any other individual, celebrated for managing&mdash;that is to say,
headache, and another malady which is anonymous, or only
known to country folk by what is termed “the spool or bone
of the breast being down.” The first she cures by a very formal
and serious process called “measuring the head.” This
is done by a ribbon, which she puts round the cranium, repeating
during the admeasurement a certain prayer or charm from
which the operation is to derive its whole efficacy. The measuring
is performed twice&mdash;in the first instance, to show that
its sutures are separated by disease, or, to speak more plainly,
that the bones of the head are absolutely opened, and that as
a natural consequence the head must be much larger than when
the patient is in a state of health. The circumference of the
first admeasurement is marked upon a ribbon, after which she
repeats the charm that is to remove the headache, and measures
the cranium again, in order to show, by a comparison of
the two ribbons, that the sutures have been closed, the charm
successful, and the headache consequently removed. It is
impossible to say how the discrepancy in the measurement is
brought about; but be that as it may, the writer of this has
frequently seen the operation performed in such a way as to
defy the most scrutinising eye to detect any appearance of
imposture, and he is convinced that in the majority of cases
there is not the slightest imposture intended. The operator
is in truth a dupe to a strong and delusive enthusiasm.</p>

<p>When the Midwife raises the spool of the breast, the operation
is conducted without any assistance from the supernatural.
If a boy or girl diminishes in flesh, is troubled with want
of rest or of appetite, without being afflicted with any particular
disease, either acute or local, the Midwife puts her
finger under the bone which projects over the pit of the stomach,
and immediately feels that “the spool of the breast is
down”&mdash;in other words, she informs the parents that the bone
is bent inwards, and presses upon <em>the heart</em>! The raising of
this precisely resembles the operation of cupping. She gets a
penny piece, which she places upon the spot affected, the
patient having been first laid in a supine posture; after this
she burns a little spirits in a tumbler in order to exhaust the
air in it; she then presses it quickly against the part which is
under the penny piece; and in a few moments, to the amazement
of the lookers-on, it is drawn strongly up, and remains
so until the heart-bone is supposed to be raised in such a manner
as that it will not return.</p>

<p>The next charm for which she is remarkable among the
people, is that by which a mote is taken out of the eye. The
manner of doing this is as follows:&mdash;A white basin is got,
and a jug of the purest water; the midwife repeatedly rinses
her mouth with the water, until it returns as pure and clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
as when she took it in. She then walks to and fro, repeating
the words of the charm, her mouth all the time filled with the
water. When the charm is finished, she pours the water out
of her mouth into the clean basin, and will point out the mote,
or whatever it may have been, floating in the water, or lying
in the bottom of the vessel. In fact, you could scarcely mention
a malady with which the Midwife of the old school was
not prepared to grapple by the aid of a charm. The toothache,
the cholic, measles, childbirth, all had their respective
charms. The latter especially required one of a very pithy
cast. Every one knows that the power of fairies in Ireland is
never so strong, nor so earnestly put forth, as in the moment
of parturition, when they strive by all possible means to secure
the new-born infant before it is christened, and leave a
changeling in its stead. Invaluable indeed is the midwife who
is possessed of a charm to prevent this, and knows how to arrange
all the ceremonies that are to be observed upon the
occasion without making any mistake, for that would vitiate
all. Many a time on such occasions have the ribs of the roof
been made to crack, the windows rattled out, the door pushed
with violence, and the whole house shaken as if it would tumble
about their heads&mdash;and all by the fairies&mdash;but to no purpose:
the charm of the midwife was a rock of defence; the
necessary precautions had been taken, and they were ultimately
forced to depart in a strong blast of wind, screaming
and howling with rage and disappointment as they went.</p>

<p>There were also charms for the diseases of cattle, to cure
which there exist in Ireland some processes of very distant
antiquity. We ourselves have seen elemental fire produced by
the friction of two green boughs together, applied as a remedy
for the black-leg and murrain. This is evidently of Pagan
origin, and must have some remote affinity with the old doctrines
of Baal, the ancient god of fire, whose worship was once
so general in Ireland.</p>

<p>Of these charms it may be said that they are all of a religious
character, some of them evidently the production of
imposture, and others apparently of those who seriously believed
in their efficacy. There is one thing peculiar about
them, which is, that they must be taught to persons of the
opposite sex: a man, for instance, cannot teach a charm to a
man, nor a woman to a woman, but he may to a woman, as a
woman may to a man. If taught or learned in violation of
this principle, they possess no virtue.</p>

<p>In treating of the Irish Midwife, we cannot permit ourselves
to overlook the superstition of the “lucky caul,” which comes so
clearly within her province. The caul is a thin membrane,
about the consistence of very fine silk, which covers the head
of a new-born infant like a cap. It is always the omen of
great good fortune to the infant and parents; and in Ireland,
when any one has unexpectedly fallen into the receipt of property,
or any other temporal good, it is customary to say
“such a person was born with a ‘lucky caul’ on his head.”</p>

<p>Why these are considered lucky, it would be a very difficult
matter to ascertain. Several instances of good fortune, happening
to such as were born with them, might by their coincidences
form a basis for the superstition; just as the fact of
three men during one severe winter having been found
drowned, each with two shirts on, generated an opinion which
has now become fixed and general in that parish, that it is
unlucky to wear two shirts at once. We are not certain whether
the caul is in general the perquisite of the Midwife&mdash;sometimes
we believe it is; at all events, her integrity occasionally
yields to the desire of possessing it. In many cases she conceals
its existence, in order that she may secretly dispose of
it to good advantage, which she frequently does; for it is considered
to be the herald of good fortune to those who can get
it into their possession. Now, let not our English neighbours
smile at us for those things until they wash their own hands
clear of such practices. At this day a caul will bring a good
price in the most civilized city in the world&mdash;to wit, the good
city of London&mdash;the British metropolis. Nay, to such lengths
has the mania for cauls been carried there, that they have been
actually advertised for in the Times newspaper.</p>

<p>Of a winter evening, at the fireside, there can be few more
amusing companions than a Midwife of the old school. She
has the smack of old times and old usages about her, and
tastes of that agreeable simplicity of manners which always
betokens a harmless and inoffensive heart. Her language is
at once easy, copious, and minute, and if a good deal pedantic,
the pedantry is rather the traditionary phraseology and
antique humour which descends with her profession, than the
peculiar property or bias of her individual mind. She affects
much mystery, and intimates that she could tell many strange
stories of high life; but she is always too honourable to betray
the confidence that has been reposed in her good faith and
secrecy. In her dress she always consults warmth and comfort,
and seldom or never looks to appearance. Flannel and
cotton she heaps on herself in abundant folds, and the consequence
is, that although subject to all the inclemency of the
seasons both by night and day, she is hardly ever known to
be sick. The cottage of the Midwife may in general be known
by the mounting-stone which is beside her door, and which
enables her without difficulty or loss of time to get on horseback
behind the impatient messenger. The window of her
bedroom is also remarkable for its opening on hinges like a
door, a thing not usual in the country. This is to enable her
to thrust forth her well-flannelled head without any possible
delay, in order to inquire the name of the party requiring her
aid, the length of journey before her, and such other particulars
as she usually deems necessary. The sleep of the Midwife
is almost peculiar in its character to herself. No person
sleeps more soundly and deeply than she does, unless to a
knock at the door or a tap at the window, to both of which
it may be said she is ever instinctively awake. We question
if a peal of cannon discharged at her house-side would disturb
her; but give on the other hand the slightest possible
knock or tap at either her door or window, and ere you could
imagine she had time to awaken, the roll of flannel that contains
her head is thrust out of the window.</p>

<p>Having thus recited everything, so far as we could remember
it, connected with the social antiquities of her calling, and
detailed some matters not generally known, that may, we trust,
be interesting to those who are fond of looking at the springs
which often move rustic society, we now close this “Essay on
Midwifery,” hoping to be able to bring the Midwife herself
personally on the stage in our next, or at least in an early
number.</p>

<span class="smaller">BY COUL GOPPAGH.</span></h2>

<p>What can have become of the old world I remember long
long ago&mdash;almost twenty years ago? It is a weary look
backward, and the distance hides it. This is not the world I
was born in. I remember when the old men used to show me
the ways they walked in, scores of years before, and the very
corners and the footpaths through the fields. Here they met
an old friend&mdash;there they took shelter from a storm. On this
lake they skated all day&mdash;from that hill they saw the ships
returning with victory from foreign war. Men walked quietly
together then in silence or friendly talk, and did not jostle
each other from the way; they went to bed and rose as the
sun did; they followed in their fathers’ ways&mdash;read the same
books, laughed at the same fine old jokes, and believed their
posterity would do the same. Old men then wore grey hairs,
and saw their children’s children, and were venerable. But
they are all gone; and could they look out of their graves (if
indeed their very graves be spared), they would not know the
old world they used to live in.</p>

<p>It is all changed now with us old fellows of five-and-twenty.
We are left doting among the ruins of our youth. There is
nothing left to us of our early days. The old crooked grassy
byeways where we went to gather blackberries and idle away
a summer day, have been gone over by the surveyor’s chain,
and some straight cut, with prim, bare fences, has run it down.
The little stream has been piped over, and, where it “babbled
o’ green fields,” is a noisy, muddy thoroughfare. Over the
green glen where the hazels nourished their brown clusters,
strides a cursed viaduct; the execrable railway has frighted
the linnets from the boughs, and a bird’s nest shall never more
be found. In the lonely bay where we used to gather shells,
thinking ourselves in fairy land, and wondering what lay beyond
the dim horizon, the steamboat roars and splashes. Riot
and swearing and slang and vice of cities have usurped the
quiet haunts of country calm and charity.</p>

<p>It is for a coming age all these things are preparing: to us
is allotted only the vexation and bewilderment. I have no
associations to link me to these horrors, and I prefer the old
repose to all the luxuries they bring. What is it to me that
I can go to East or West in so many days sooner, or even if
the sun that sets on me to-night should rise for me to-morrow
by the Ganges? Here is my “fortunate isle;” this is my
home where my heart is. I have no business with Egypt or
the Nile. I wish to sit undisturbed by my own fireside, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
walk under the old trees, to look on my own fields, to be
warmed by my own sun. But they will dig a canal through
my silent walks, and the infernal city will pour through these
banks its restless impurity, and make them echo with the laughter
of brutal debauchery.</p>

<p>It is something for a man to look on the same scenes he
looked on in his childhood, among the same fields and trees
and household ways his forefathers tilled and planted, and
knew before him. There is a sanctity grows round them year
by year, enriching the heart, that cannot be broken through
nor profaned without a loss never to be repaired. The exile
can still listen to the whispering of the woods and the sound
of the streams, but he remembers the woods and waters of
his native land with tears. In twenty years I have grown old
and an exile where I was born. Huge piles have covered the
green where I played. The roar of busy streets insults the
memory of the green lanes where I strolled at evening.</p>

<p>There is no country now. The city has invaded the solitude,
and vice and impudent folly march in its rear. The
bumpkin imitates the swagger of the citizen&mdash;the ploughman
talks politics&mdash;the haymaker shakes the swathe and discourses
of political economy&mdash;the reaper questions the revenue.</p>

<p>The mountains yet remain! I can see them, still, from my
door; I can see them from the city streets. I can climb up
their rugged sides still, and bless God that no discoverer as
yet has uprooted the hills.</p>

<p>My heart is with them, for they have not changed. With
them I have still a sovereign sympathy, for I can look on them
and renew the fancies of my infancy. There is not a torrent
pouring down their sides, not a crag nor a bramble, that is
not reverend in my eye.</p>

<p>The world is drunk, and raves. Come away from these
reeling bacchanals, and let us fare among the hills! Long
ago, before the time of history, some naked savage here has
worshipped the sunrise; some Druid sacrificed his victims;
some barbarian Spartacus, lurking among the wild deer and
the wolves, has defied his nation; some young warrior, with
tears on his hardy cheek, has pointed up thither, whispering to
one beside him dearer than his name, his clan, or his life, and
sped away on the wings of love to the peace and safety of the
mountains.</p>

<p>These noble fronts have never varied. The clouds float
here over the same ridges on which the eyes of our childhood
rested, and of the men of old time. The clank of monstrous
engines has never yet dismayed the primeval stillness.</p>

<p>The skeleton of creation is visible here, and we see the beginnings
of the world. This solid granite sparkled in the sun
when “the evening and the morning were the first day,” and
was as firm and solid to the centre when the world was “without
form and void.” This whinstone rock has been hardened
in some earthquake furnace long since then, and these flints
are new, though they held fire before Prometheus suffered.
This soft soil is the relics of the life and death of a thousand
green years, and the fresh bloom that feeds on its decay will
nourish succeeding blossoms.</p>

<p>The Western nations look here for the dawn, and the people
of the East for sunset. Young children look up here from
cottage doors at evening, and see the portals of Paradise
opened, gazing through vistas brighter than imagination, unfolding
far into the heart of heaven, and hold their breath,
waiting for the passage of the archangels. This is a glorified
soil. On these peaks hang the morning and the evening
stars. The sun and the moon come here to do them honour;
and they clothe themselves with gold and azure, and purple,
deeper than the Tyrian, to receive their celestial guests.</p>

<p>High up here in this blessed solitude there is life, and liberty
of heart, and sacred peace. No fenced-in space confines me
here. I breathe in a domain as wide as the horizon, as high
as the planets and the sun. The clouds are my fellow-wanderers
here, and enjoy with me the liberal bosom of the air.
Their ethereal hills and dales invite my fancy to a real heaven,
where I gather all I love around me. Their shadows cover
me as they pass over, and I bid them “God speed” as they
carry cool showers down to the thirsting land. No miserable
moan of want or sickness, no sob of long-breaking hearts,
no choked sigh of cheated hope, nor any human woe, alarms
me here. I see no loathsome household, plague-stricken with
poverty, and festering in filth, despised of men, and famishing
into horrors and crime: no form of woman (black shame
before God!) wading in fœtid rags through mire and snow,
with those awful human (!) children of hers, debased as the
swine with whom they sleep (for charity!) and on whom the
rich man looks&mdash;poor unreckoning fool!&mdash;and never pauses to
think and tremble.</p>

<p>Here the wild bee sings among the rich fragrance of the
heather-bells and thyme, gathering pure honey, fresh from
the breath of the immediate sunrise. The larks have their
nests among the heath by thousands, and make the whole
mountain musical. Many strange insects, born and dying in
the hour, that live on dew-drops, buzz by, and a thousand unknown
creatures, gifted with voice, inhabiting small twigs in
labyrinths of greenest moss, join in the hymn. The invisible
wind, like a ruler of the strings, pours in a sovereign master-note
that blends in all one solemn harmony, filling the air till
the valleys sing for joy.</p>

<p>Here is Solitude, unforced, and free as the wandering wind.
Here is peace like the summer life of untrodden blossoms.
Here is a lofty quiet as of the dreams of the heart over its
holy memories. Here are everlasting rocks, steadfast as honour,
and true. Here is wealth for Fancy, and a dwelling for
Imagination. Wide and far as the peaks can seek the heavens,
there is no place for Envy or Hate, where the glens are
vocal, and the holy silence compels the heart to adoration,
making a haven for religion among the mighty hills.</p>

<p>What throes of central agony heaved up these huge mountains,
twisting and folding each into each away as far as the
eye can follow! What pangs and convulsions at the heart!
What startling from chaotic trance, long before man or his
mammoth ancestors, at the creative song of some wandering
star-messenger, millions of years upon its way!</p>

<p>My heart enlarges here, and recognises an aërial amity with
the sky. I am filled with celestial promptings. I shake off
all incumbrance of the earth. I stretch out my arms to the
blue heaven, and its breath comes into my bosom as a friend.
The stir of humanity is dumb beneath me. I leap among the
heathy knolls. I sing beside the infant rivers. I shout, and
hear answers from the lurking echoes, like the mysterious
voices of infinite years. I drink in unused air with</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">That in the colours of the rainbow live,</div>
<div class="verse">And play i’ the plighted clouds.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I stand wrapt in mute visions, growing into the majesty of
the mountains. I spurn Decay and Time. I share the enduring
strength, and carry lightly the burden of centuries.</p>

<p>The mountains swell up around me like a sea with billows.
My footfall is inaudible, and I fleet to and fro like the unbodied
soul of a great poet that makes the worlds it sees. There
are no furrows on this soil: the curse has not fallen here.
The sweat of the brow has not dropped here, nor aught save
the rain and the dew of heaven. I am still nearer to the angels,
and my spirit begins to put forth unaccustomed wings.</p>

<p>The ancient gods still linger here, and Antiquity has not
yet grown old. The world has not yet heard “the voice of
one crying in the wilderness,” nor has Paul yet preached.
Here I am a devout Pagan. I am the friend of Plato; I remember
the voice of Socrates. I worship the Gods reverently,
and have come up hither with sacrifice according to
the voice of the oracle.</p>

<p>I have drunk with the muses at this fountain. Here, under
the hanging ivy from the rock, I behold the real Castaly; and
wherever the stream may wander, it will carry music on its
way from divinest voices. From this clump I have listened
to Apollo teaching the shepherds. Yea, I feel my veins
tingling with a more celestial liquor; I own invulnerable limbs,
and am myself a God!</p>

<p>It was not Mercury, but I, who passed swiftly down yon
green declivity with feathered feet, and away over the hill-tops
like the shadow of a cloud. Those cattle brousing in the
thicket, far down the ravine, I stole from Pieria. I bear the
imperial mandates, and the breeze carries the sound of my
eloquence through all the forests.</p>

<p>But I aspire to loftier seats. This is the high Olympus;
Saturn is baffled, and immortal Jove laughs at the terrible prophecies
of the enduring Titan. Let him rend his rivets. Let
him melt the heart of Caucasus, or appease the Vulture!
Would that I could as easily escape the reproaches of Juno, or
overcome Danäe! But it shall rain gold to-morrow in her lap,
and Leda shall fondle in her snowier bosom a snowy swan.
Meanwhile let the nectar be poured! The laughing gods surround
me, and I know immortal vigour. How Mercury jeered
at the grinning Vulcan erewhile as he writhed his iron sinews,
when I held him over the edge of heaven! Here I compel the
clouds around me; I sit throned, and thunder.</p>

<p>A louder thunder has been heard than Jove’s. There is a

there to talk with God, and came down with the brightness

which shook Babylon, and quelled the Assyrian. The Persian
rolled away before it like a cloud. The Egyptian, Greek, and
Roman, have fled from it for ever.</p>

<p>But a greater than Moses has made the mountains holy. A

<h2 class="gap4">THE SNUFF SHOP.</h2>

<p>Few, we dare say, ever entered a shop of the description
named in the title of this paper with any other idea than that
they were entering merely a repository of Lundy Foot, cigars,
and small twist. Few, we suppose, ever looked on such a
place in any other light, or ever considered its keeper in any
other point of view than that simply of a tobacconist. Yet is
there another light, and a dismal one it is, in which both the
snuff shop and the snuff dealer himself may be looked upon;
and it is in such a light that we ourselves always do look upon
them. This is, viewing the one as a charnel-house of defunct
authors; the other as a goul, battening on their mortal remains.
We sometimes vary this horrifying, but, alas! too
correct view of the snuff shop and the snuff dealer, by supposing
the one a sort of literary shambles or slaughter-house, and
the other a cold-blooded, merciless literary butcher.</p>

<p>Taking either of these views of the snuff shop, what a change
takes place in its aspect, and in that of every thing and person
pertaining to it! What a dismal and hideous den it then becomes,
and what a truculent, savage-looking fiend becomes
that smiling and simpering tobacconist! No bowels of compassion
has he for the mangled and mutilated authors that are
lying thick around him, cruelly Burked by his own merciless
hands. No; there he sits in the midst of the dire carnage as
calm and unconcerned as if he had nothing whatever to do
with it&mdash;the callous monster!</p>

<p>Pursuing the idea just broached, let us enter this horrid
den, and for a moment contemplate its interior in a spirit in
accordance with that idea; for, not being authors, we have
nothing to fear for ourselves, it being that class only that
need stand in awe of the snuff shop&mdash;to all others it is a harmless
place enough.</p>

<p>Lo! then, behold (giving us the advantage here of a little
stretch of imagination), the walls bespattered with the blood
and brains of murdered authors; and see that blood-stained
bench which the demon of the place calls a counter; and in
various other depositories around lie their dismembered limbs
and mangled carcases. Oh, it is a shocking and heart-rending
sight!</p>

<p>Some of those unfortunates have evidently died hard: they
have the appearance of having struggled desperately for life.
But, alas, in vain! An irresistible destiny thrust them into the
fatal snuff shop, where they perished quickly and miserably by
the hand of the ruthless savage within. Others, again, seem
to have quietly resigned themselves to their fate, and, indeed,
to have been more than half dead before they were brought
in; while others, again, appear to have been wholly defunct,
having died a natural death. These, then, have been conveyed
thither merely to be cut up, and converted to the degrading
uses of the tobacconist.</p>

<p>Although some of the unhappy authors whose mangled
remains strew this den of horrors seem to have attained a
kind of maturity before they were cruelly torn to pieces as we
now see them, by far the greater number are a sort of murdered
innocents, having been strangled in their birth, or shortly
after. A good many there are, too, who seem to have been
dead born, or to have perished while yet in embryo.</p>

<p>Piteous as it is to look on the heavy, sturdy corpses of the
murdered prose writers that lie thickly up and down this
chamber of death, yet infinitely more piteous is it to contemplate
the delicate, fragile forms of the poets thus cruelly mangled
and mutilated that lie no less thickly around us. Poor
dear, unfledged things! What a fate has been thine!&mdash;what
a destiny, to be consigned, ere ye had yet opportunity to open
your little musical throats, to the tender mercies of <em>that</em> literary
Burke&mdash;that ruthless monster whom the world, thinking
of him only in connection with cigars and pigtail, calls a
tobacconist. Where now, sweet little humming birds, be those
soft and tender notes with which ye sought, alas, how vainly!
to charm the huge, rude ear of an uncouth and barbarous
world that would not listen to ye? Alas, they have ceased
for ever! How little does that savage, the demon of the place,
mind your sweet, small voices, that give forth a piteous wail,
like the last notes of the dying swan, every time he lays his
merciless hands on you. Little, indeed! Let but a customer
come in for half an ounce of “Blackguard,” and he will, without
the smallest hesitation or compunction, seize one of you,
dear unfortunates, and tear you limb from limb for his own
and that customer’s conveniency: ay, for a paltry three half-pence,
mayhap less&mdash;a pennyworth of “Scotch”&mdash;will he perpetrate
this atrocious deed. That sanguinary bench, that horrid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
counter, is strewn over with your slim carcases and fragile
limbs; and your murderer is hanging over your mutilated remains,
laughing and chatting and joking with his customers
as pleasantly and unconcernedly as if you were so much waste
paper. Oh, it is atrocious!</p>

<p>Such, then, dear reader, is the light&mdash;a terrible one, indeed,
but as thou wilt acknowledge, we have no doubt, a correct
one&mdash;in which we look upon snuff shops, which, as thou well
knowest, have long lain, and not unjustly, under the stigma
of being fatal to authors. If thou art one, pray, then, eschew
it; for if thou dost once enter its dismal portals, thou wilt
never, never more be heard of in this world!</p>

<h2 class="gap4">ANIMAL TAMING.</h2>

<h3>SECOND AND CONCLUDING ARTICLE.</h3>

<p>In my last paper on the taming of animals, I treated the subject
generally rather than in detail. It is probable that the
curious reader may not be displeased to learn a little more of
the mode of keeping and domesticating wild and savage animals,
as well as the methods to be adopted in order to bring
together fierce animals of different species, and induce them
to occupy the same cage in peace and harmony, and without
danger of contention. It is, as will be at once recognised,
this latter circumstance which renders the exhibitions of Van
Amburgh and his rivals as wonderful as they are; it being
a far easier matter to reconcile a lion or a tiger to yourself,
and even familiarize it to the furthest possible degree, than it
is to induce the tiger and the lion to consort together, and
refrain from engaging in deadly conflict.</p>

<p>Let us suppose, for the sake of illustration of the mode
which should be adopted to tame two or more animals, that
you are made a present of a lion and a tiger. If the animals
be very young, you will have very little trouble with them for
a long time&mdash;none, indeed, beyond the necessity of attending
to their health, for the larger felines are difficult to be reared;
but as they grow older, they will be very apt to quarrel between
themselves; wounds will be given and received, and
the death or maiming of either, or perhaps of both, will pretty
speedily result. To guard against any unpleasantness of this
nature, it should be your business the instant you receive the
animals to commence operations. Let them be kept at first
far apart; for it is not advisable, as their dispositions may be
very different, that one should be witness of the severity you
may be compelled to exercise towards the other. This done,
take, according to the animals’ ages, a stout cane, a supplejack,
or an iron rod. If the creatures be very young, that is,
under three months, or perhaps four, the cane will be sufficient.
If greater, or from that to half grown, you will require the
supplejack, and let it be thicker at one end than at the other.
For a half-grown animal the iron rod will be absolutely necessary,
and it must be of sufficient weight that a blow of it
on the skull may be sufficient to produce a temporary insensibility&mdash;the
only chance you will have of escape, should the
fierce brutes at any time take it into their heads to rebel.</p>

<p>Having thus provided yourself with arms offensive, you
must be equally cautious as to your costume. That must be
of strong material, hard, and fitting close. You must have
no loose flapping skirts, no open jackets. All must be tight,
and buttoned closely to the body. An under-waistcoat
(sleeved) of strong buff, with a stout pea-jacket over it, leather
or corduroy breeches, and top boots, is about the best
dress for the experimentalist in animal taming that I can suggest
at this moment. The reason&mdash;for I like to give a reason
for everything I recommend&mdash;of this necessity for a firm, tight-fitting
dress, is, that if a wild animal, although to all appearance
perfectly domesticated, chances even in play to get his
claws fastened in your clothes, the sensation of seizing upon
prey involuntarily presents itself to his imagination. The accidental
entanglement is succeeded by a plunge of the claws,
the jaws are brought into requisition, and your life is by no
means in a safe position. Hence the necessity for tight dress.</p>

<p>Thus accoutred, with your rod in your hand, and, if the
animal be more than half grown, a brace of pistols in your
breast&mdash;the one loaded with ball, the other with powder, upon
which a quantity of tow has been crammed down&mdash;approach
the cage of the young animal which you design to tame. I
commence with this stage of the process, because I presume
that you have already rendered your protegé sufficiently familiar
by feeding and caressing it through the bars, and by
spending some time each day in its company. I presume
therefore that it has already begun to recognise your appearance,
and to come over to your hand when called, as well as
to permit you to stroke and pat it, without attempting to bite
you. Approach the cage, hold in your left hand a heavy
cloak or blanket wrapped round your hand and arm; let
there be two assistants near at hand, and a small stove in
which half a dozen iron rods are heating; let the door of the
cage be a real door, opening upon hinges, and shutting with
a good and deeply-notched latch&mdash;not a sliding door, as such
a mode of entering the cage might be as much as your life was
worth. Speak kindly to the animal, and caress it through
the bars of its cage ere you enter, or the suddenness of your
entrance may irritate or alarm it, and thus induce it to attack
you. Your costume should likewise by no means have been
put on for the first time. You should have dressed in a similar
manner during all your former visits, so that your intended
pet might be acquainted with your appearance. Let a platform
be erected outside the cage, to its level, and ascend this,
where stand a few minutes, boldly caressing and speaking to
the animal. Then throw open the door, enter with a firm
and resolute step, push the door behind you, but see that you
do not for an instant remove your eyes from those of the animal
you are visiting. Do not advance from the door; stand
near the bars of the cage, that you may have a better chance
of escape, and may be more readily assisted by your attendants
in the event of an attack. Speak kindly towards the
animal, and if it, as it most likely will, comes over to you, fear
nothing, but stretch forth your hand and caress it. The creature
will then probably purr, and rub against you. Permit it
to do so, and encourage it in its familiarity; but if it offer to
play with you, repress such disposition with firmness; and if
you perceive that the animal is bent on frolic, leave the cage
at once, for it is unsafe longer to remain, the play of these
savage creatures always leading to mischief, just as the cat
sports with the captured mouse ere she gives it the finishing
blow, and buries it in her maw. Repress, therefore, every attempt
to play. Use your rod freely and severely. Do so not
merely for a grievous fault, but for the most distant appearance
of insubordination. Let your corrections be terrible
when you do inflict them, and you will have to repeat them so
much the less frequently. Some, and Van Amburgh I believe
among the rest, are in favour of beating the animals
every morning, whether they deserve such chastisement or
not, just by way of keeping up a salutary awe of their masters.
I object to this, as I conceive it to be both cruel and
unnecessary. If animals are of an unruly disposition, and require
frequent correction, I should rather recommend that
they should be visited every morning, and an opportunity of
misbehaving themselves thus afforded, when indeed a good
thrashing might be administered with much greater justice.
Never display either timidity or ill-humour. The former will
make the animals despise your menaces, and perhaps give you
a bite or a claw&mdash;the latter will cause them to hate you, to
regard you as a tyrant, and probably seize on the first favourable
opportunity for your destruction. Be just, therefore,
in your punishments, and do not be too familiar. Never for
an instant permit any animal to make too free with you. Recollect
the old copybook adage, “Familiarity breeds contempt;”
and recollect that if a young lion or a tiger so far
forgets himself as to despise your authority, you will stand a
fair chance of being torn to pieces some fine morning, and devoured
for their breakfast.</p>

<p>I conceive that the preceding rapidly sketched hints will
serve as a sufficient ground-work for the animal-tamer to act
upon. He must not be discouraged if he do not succeed at
first, and he must be satisfied to take time, and persevere.
Without this he need not hope for success.</p>

<p>The animal-tamer must be fearless&mdash;such a thing as terror
must be a feeling wholly foreign to his soul. He must be as
brave as a lion: for how can he otherwise hope to subdue the
bravest of the animal creation? I have said “bravest,” and
so let the word stand; but I was perhaps led to employ the
expression rather from popular prejudice, than from a conviction
of its truth. The feline tribes are very powerful and very
fierce animals, but they are by no means brave. A bulldog has
more courage in his pigmy body, than exists in the prodigious
carcasses or a dozen lions or tigers. Let the animal-tamer
recollect this, and the knowledge of this fact will probably encourage
him. To give a case in point:&mdash;I was once endeavouring
to make friends with the tigress in the Zoological Gardens,
Phœnix Park&mdash;a beautiful animal, subsequently purchased from
the Zoological Society by the proprietors of the Portobello<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
Gardens, and since unfortunately dead. I had got so far as
to be able to stroke the creature on the head and back, and
even to open her mouth with my hand, and leave it within
her terrible jaws. This I did on my third visit to her, in
presence of the animal’s keeper. One day I was alone with
the tigress, and my hand was upon her neck: she with equal
good nature had placed her enormous paw upon my shoulder,
and was purring in a most affectionate manner, when a sudden
noise from one of the other animals caused me to start;
instantly the paw was brought down upon my arm with some
violence, and before I could extricate my hand, Kate, as the
tigress was called, had closed her teeth upon the limb, which she
held firmly, though as yet uninjured. I strove to withdraw my
hand, but to no purpose. I felt in a most uncomfortable position,
reader, for I feared that I should lose a very useful
member of my frame: it was my <em>right</em> hand. Had I lost it, I
should have been unable to have written this or any of the
other papers I have given you. The teeth of the tigress became
more and more firmly closed, and my efforts to disengage
my hand were unavailing; I called for assistance, but no one
was within hearing; when, calling courage and resolution to
my aid, I bethought me of my own principles, and, raising my
other hand, dealt Kate as severe a blow as I was able with
my clenched fist upon her nose. The experiment was successful.
The animal, at once releasing my hand, sprang with
an angry howl to the opposite side of her cage, from which
in a few moments she returned cowering and submissive, apparently
eager to regain that portion of my good opinion that
she seemed conscious of having forfeited.</p>

<p>If, then, you are attacked, act with promptness and decision.
Use your rod freely; but if you find yourself in danger, employ
your pistol, not, however, that loaded with ball (reserve it as
a last resource, when there is nought else between you and
death), but that loaded only with powder and tow; fire it into
the animal’s face, and I think there is no doubt but it will
afford you ample time for escape; nay, it may in all likelihood
render you conqueror; and if you perceive that the shock has
terrified your assailant, hand the pistol to be re-loaded by an
assistant, while you advance and finish with your rod what the
pistol began. If you be seized and overpowered, let your
attendants use the heated irons; they should be of a sufficient
length to reach to any part of the cage, and should be applied
to the nose and mouth. They will generally be found successful
in turning the current of affairs.</p>

<p>Ere taking leave of my readers, I must say a few words as
to introducing animals of different species to each other. A
very brief notice, comprised under one or two heads, will suffice.
First, let <em>each</em> animal be perfectly and individually under
your control. Secondly, do not put the strangers into the
same cage all at once, but put them into a cage partitioned by
an iron railing, in which leave them for a few weeks, until you
begin to perceive that they have made each other’s acquaintance,
and may be trusted together; and do you enter the cage
with them when first brought together, and visit the least
symptom of hostility with instant and effective chastisement.
They should not at first be left together entirely, but only for
an hour or two each day while it is convenient to you to attend.
By and bye, when they become sufficiently familiarized, you
need be under no apprehension. When two animals have been
brought together, it will be comparatively easy and safe to introduce
a third, then a fourth, and so on; the safety increasing
in proportion to their numbers. Make it also your business
to select your animals with judgment. To an old leopard
introduce a young lion, for instance, because the leopard will,
in consequence of the youth of his new acquaintance, crow over
him, and aid you in subduing him. This advantage, to be
gained by observing dissimilarity of ages, is by no means to be
overlooked, as it is a powerful agent in the work of domestication
and association of the different species of animals.
When one animal is of a timid kind&mdash;the natural prey probably
of the other, which latter is fierce and powerful&mdash;you have
nothing to do but to make the more powerful animal <em>afraid</em> of
its timid and defenceless companion. This may be done in
various modes, just as the time or opportunities may suggest.
A simple illustration may serve. Take a young cat and put
her into a cage. Take a rat’s or a mouse’s skin, and fill it
with hot scalding bran; throw it to the cat, and when she
runs at it, take hold of her and thrust the hot skin into her
mouth; keep it there for a minute till she is well burned, and
you have rendered that cat ever afterwards harmless towards
mice, at least towards such as you may introduce to her; a
wild one which she met with at large might fare differently,
though I hardly think she would even attempt to injure it.
Treat a bird-skin in this manner, and, after the scalding, tie
it for a while around puss’s neck, and you have secured your
aviary from molestation. Sometimes the first experiment of
this kind is not successful. When such is the case, however,
be not disheartened, but repeat it; and one or two such inflictions
cannot fail being effective. You may thus have cats,
rats, mice, birds, &amp;c., &amp;c., all in one cage; a curiosity I have
often beheld, and which I have myself succeeded in forming in
the manner I have described.</p>

<p>Let not the reader who may endeavour to put the above
rules in practice be disheartened by a little difficulty at starting.
The power of nature is strong, and it is not until after
a long and severe course of training that art can expect to
overcome it. Let, therefore, the experimenter ever bear in
mind the extraordinary force of nature, and the vast labour
necessary to keep it in abeyance; and in order that he should
do so, I shall tell him the following anecdote:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Cecco maintained that nature was more potent than art,
while Dante asserted the contrary. To prove his principle
the great Italian bard referred to his cat, which by repeated
practice he had taught to hold a candle in its paw while he
supped or read. Cecco desired to witness the experiment,
and came not unprepared for his purpose. When Dante’s cat
was performing its part, Cecco lifted up the lid of a pot which
he had filled with mice; the creature of art instantly showed
the weakness of a talent merely acquired, and, dropping the
candle, sprang on the mice with all its instinctive propensity.
Dante was himself disconcerted; and it was adjudged that
the advocate for the occult principle of natural faculties had
gained his cause.” Bear this anecdote therefore in mind.
Do not forget the power of natural instinct, even over the
most careful artificial training; and let it be your anxious
care to keep far distant every circumstance that might provoke
the awakening of the one, or tend to shake or to subvert
the influence of the other.</p>

<p>This short sketch has, I trust, given my readers an insight
into the mode by which Van Amburgh and his rivals perform
their wonders; and I can assure them, that by following the
principles I have here laid down, they may themselves, if they
choose, equal in their own private menageries the performances
of those public exhibitors.</p>

pretend to increase our present stock, but make us economists

lies in regret or anticipation; he therefore is most wise who
thinks of the present alone, regardless of the past or future.
This is impossible to a man of pleasure; it is difficult to the
man of business, and is in some degree attainable by the philosopher.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
